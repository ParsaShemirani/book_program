Start by scanning the marked 'page 1' in the book, scan including the blank pages.
Manually section off the parts before and after the numbered pages
such as 'table of contents', 'preface', 'introduction'.

Levels of info:

- Individual page scans
- JSON key value pairs for a page, generated by AI via structured format
- Markdown representation of individual pages
- 


Current focus: Defining a structure for the AI Vision model
to analyze the page scan with, return the representation with distinct
elements of the page.

Idea: Make a list of elements in structured format, top to bottom left to right.

Questions: Should I just have a key value pair system to extract things like header,
page number, footer, main text, figures, etc? Or should I do a list of elements approach?


For now: Lets move without elements, simple key value system for non advanced books,
primarily main text books.
