when people drive like that; I really wish
they would see the danger in what they are
doing!" Whew! I was amazed how I could
create a less stressful situation for myself by
simply becoming aware of what I was feeling

my thinking instead to what the other driver might be feeling
and needing. I sensed that the person was
lost, feeling confused, and wishing for some
patience from those of us following. When the
road widened enough for me to pass, I saw that
the driver was a woman who looked to be in
her eighties with an expression of terror on her face. I was pleased
that my attempt at empathy had kept me from honking the horn
or engaging in my customary tactics of displaying displeasure
toward people whose driving bothered me.

### Replacing Diagnosis With NVC

Many years ago, after having just invested nine years of my

a group of mental health professionals.

In this dialogue Buber posits that human growth occurs through
a meeting between two individuals who express themselves
vulnerably and authentically in what he termed an "I-Thou"
