sides or even care primarily what their stories were. Recognizing
that all stories lead to conflict, either overtly or covertly, he
focused on connections as a psychological bridge. This is in
keeping with another axiom of Ahimsa: It's not what you do that
counts, it's the quality of your attention. As far as the legal system
is concerned, a divorce is over once the two parties settle on how
to split their assets. But this is far from the result that's reached
emotionally between the two divorced parties. Too much has been
said, to use Marshall's wording, that changed their world.

Aggression is built into the ego system, which totally focuses
on "I, me, and mine" whenever conflict arises. Society pays lip
service to saints and their vow to serve God instead of themselves,
but there's a huge gap between the values we espouse and the way
we actually live. Ahimsa closes this gap only by expanding a
person's awareness. The only way to resolve all violence is to give
up your story. No one can be enlightened who still has a personal
stake in the world—that could be the third axiom of Ahimsa. But
this seems like a teaching as radical as Jesus in the Sermon on
the Mount when he promises that the meek shall inherit the earth.

In both cases, the point isn't to change your actions but to
change your consciousness. To do that, you must walk a path from
A to B, where A is a life based on the incessant demands of the
ego and B is selfless awareness. To be frank, nobody really desires
selfless awareness; from the viewpoint of looking out for number
one, it sounds at once scary and impossible. What's the payoff if
you depose the ego, which is all about payoffs? Once the ego is
gone, do you sit around passively like a spiritual beanbag?

The answer lies in those moments when the personal self
falls away naturally and spontaneously. These occur in moments
of meditation or simply deep contentment. Selfless awareness is
the state we're in when Nature or art or music creates a sense of
wonder. The only difference between those moments—to which we
can add all experiences of creativity, love, and play—and Ahimsa
is that they flicker in and out while Ahimsa is a settled state.
It reveals that stories and the egos that fuel them are illusions,
self-created models for survival and selfishness. The payoff for
