  "main_text": "when people drive like that; I really wish\nthey would see the danger in what they are\ndoing!\" Whew! I was amazed how I could\ncreate a less stressful situation for myself by\nsimply becoming aware of what I was feeling\nand needing rather than blaming others.\n\nLater I decided to practice empathy toward other drivers and\nwas rewarded with a gratifying first experience. I was stuck\nbehind a car going far below the speed limit and slowing down\nat every intersection. Fuming and grumbling, \"That's no way\nto drive,\" I noticed the stress I was causing myself and shifted\nmy thinking instead to what the other driver might be feeling\nand needing. I sensed that the person was\nlost, feeling confused, and wishing for some\npatience from those of us following. When the\nroad widened enough for me to pass, I saw that\nthe driver was a woman who looked to be in\nher eighties with an expression of terror on her face. I was pleased\nthat my attempt at empathy had kept me from honking the horn\nor engaging in my customary tactics of displaying displeasure\ntoward people whose driving bothered me.\n\n### Replacing Diagnosis With NVC\n\nMany years ago, after having just invested nine years of my\nlife in the training and diplomas necessary to qualify as a\npsychotherapist, I came across a dialogue between the Israeli\nphilosopher Martin Buber and the American psychologist Carl\nRogers in which Buber questions whether anyone can do\npsychotherapy in the role of a psychotherapist. Buber was\nvisiting the United States at the time and had been invited, along\nwith Carl Rogers, to a discussion at a mental hospital in front of\na group of mental health professionals.\n\nIn this dialogue Buber posits that human growth occurs through\na meeting between two individuals who express themselves\nvulnerably and authentically in what he termed an \"I-Thou\""
