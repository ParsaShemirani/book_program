Currently, I am wondering how I will split apart the book
into sections, considering that there are not only numbered
chapters but also sections in the 'front and back matter' of the book.

My first idea: Lets scan the book with scan 1 being the front cover and the last scan
being the back cover. We will start by taking a look at the table of contents provided.
We then use this table of contents to layout our 'sections' which include
chapter, preface, index, etc. Then, we will include a list of these sections
in the extraction prompts for the pages, and give each one a 'section id'.
The model can identify if this is the start of a new section and give its id.
This way, it can also identify non numerical sections like the preface.

Also, I am pondering how to keep track of what data corresponds to what page scan.
I can make a csv file which links response ID to scan id.
