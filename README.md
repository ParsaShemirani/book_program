# book_program
Scan physical books and generate markdown, audiobook, pdf, and more.

## The process:
- Start by taking a picture / scan of the book. The first scan being the front cover, last scan being back cover. Including blank pages, front and back of every page.
- Make a directory dedicated to this book, and make a sub directory called "page_scans" and upload the scans there.
- Use the indexing tool to change the filenames to the scan index.
